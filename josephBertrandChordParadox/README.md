The three classical solutions for the Joseph Bertrand's chords paradox

Problem: What is the probability that a random chord in a circunference is longer than the side of the equilateral inscribed triangle?

Method 1:
      Given two random points A and B what is the probability that the chord formed by them is longer than the side of the triangle?
      
      Solution: Choose point A randomly. Then rotate the triangle in a way one of its vertices coincides with A. We can then affirm the ods that the chord AB is longer than the sides of the triangle is exactly 1/3. The reason being point B must be choosen between the two sides of triangle. The angle between the two sides is 60 degrees so 1/3 of the 180 degrees spectrum. See image for a visual explanation.

            <h2>High Concept</h2>
            <p>You have a precious blazing stone and a blancket. Keep it under control by thorwing it up and not letting it fall on the floor until it cools down!</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p>You get into a precious stones refinery. You are looking to get rich, but for that you must get hold of your stones!</p>
            <p>This games is very chaotic and designed to be mechanically difficult! So be ready, for the stone is not just going up and down. There are other objects and they are going to collide and change its trajectory! </p>
            <p>The player will be motivated by the mechanical challenges and high score count more than anything. </p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <p>The player only moves in a horizontal line near the bottom of the screen. He must be below the ball when it gets close to the "floor"</p>
            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <ul>
            <li> &lt;-or A to move left</li>
            <li> -> or D to move right</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Onboarding</h3>
            <p>The main menu will contain visual guidance to the controller, and the different collisions that may happen. Other than that it is very obvious how the game is played</p>
            <h3>Player learning</h3>
            <p>There will be a lot of random things that may occur. Sometimes it will be impossible to beat the game</p>
            <p>One thing the player will have to learn is to pay attention to multiple things at once. There will be visual cues that show when a random object is spawning.
        </div>

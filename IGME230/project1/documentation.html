                        <li> Made a template file on paper and from that I made my css and Homepage. The others came naturally from this</li>

				            <li>Initial Idea
                            <ul>
                                <li>Experiment with collisions</li>
                                <li>Make a game that would allow me learn more advanced collision algorithms (non-AABB and non-circle)</li>
                                <li>Worked, mostly successfuly with Rectangle collision with torque</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li> Fall Back One
                            <ul>
                                <li>Decided it would be impossible for me to accomplish what I wanted</li>
                                <li>I would just not be able to make a fluid game with what I had!</li>
                                <li>Replaced my project for another one using a physics engine</li>
                                <li>Mostly unsuccessfuly. I took a long time to figure out syntax</li>
                                <li>Achieved a (barely) sustainable world with some of what I initially intended</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Realised I was not actually doing the project, just an experiment</li>
                                <li>I was not even using PIXI renderer at that point!</li>
                                <li>Completely restructured my project</li>
                                <li>I tried making an interesting and simple game</li>

                            <li>It should handle everything you expect from a game:</li>
                            <li>No abrupt end, or start. Restarting the game does not cause issues!</li>
                            <li>The minimun height is 700px and the minimun width is 525px</li>
                            <li>There are two additional stylesheets that inted to solve nay issues</li>
                            <li>I believe I met every requirement. Maybe my local storage is not as good, but it is a bug I really could not fix.</li>
                            <li>Above and Beyond
                                <ul>
                                    <li>I believe I did a great job regarding my code</li>
                                    <li>It is very well modularized and organized. I use 14 Javascript Files!</li>

<h3>II Genre</h3>
2D Pinball

### III Platform
Desktop Only

<h3>IV Story/Theme</h3>
With the objective of acquiring precious stones in mind you walk in a refinery. You look around and with a smile in your face you realise you are in the right spot!
Diamonds fly above your head! You jump ang get a large one, just to drop in on the floor and loose it from sight, however. It was Blazing hot!!
Knowing this you change your strategy! You get the blanket to your adventure and use that to get hold of the stones. Again, however, it was too hot!
At a glimpse you figure out what to do! As long as they don't fall in the floor nor get into the massive transports tubes they will cool down.

### VI Gameplay
**Mechanics**  
The player only moves in a horizontal line near the bottom of the screen. He must be below the ball when it gets close to the "floor"

**Controls**

<-or A to move left
-> or D to move right

**Onboarding**  
The main menu will contain visual guidance to the controller, and the different collisions that may happen. Other than that it is very obvious how the game is played

**Player learning**  
There will be a lot of random things that may occur. Sometimes it will be impossible to beat the game

One thing the player will have to learn is to pay attention to multiple things at once. There will be visual cues that show when a random object is spawning.

        <p><b>What are the differences from regular Online Chess?</b></p>
        <li><b>Invalid moves: you are allowed to hurt yourself!</b>
        <p>In Online Chess you are not allowed to put your king in check. Also when your king is in check, you are also not 
        allowed to make moves that do not put him in a safe position. Here you are free to do both.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Checkmate: you have to capture the king!</b>
        <p>The same way you can hurt yourself by making an invalid move, you can make the mistake of missing a checkmate in
        0! That is not allowed in Online Chess, as the game ends as soon as one of the players has no valid moves.</p>
